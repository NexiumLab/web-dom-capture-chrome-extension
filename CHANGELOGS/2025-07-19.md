# Changelog - 2025-07-19

## ‚ú® Features
- **Modularize JavaScript:** Refactored `popup.js` by extracting the server communication logic into a separate module (`js/api.js`).
- **Build Process:** Set up a Webpack build process to handle ES6 modules, making the code more maintainable.
- **Loading Animation:** Added a loading GIF to the popup to provide visual feedback during DOM capture and server communication.
- **Success Indicator:** Added a success checkmark (‚úÖ) for better user feedback upon completion.
- **Auto-recompile:** Added an `npm run watch` script for automatic recompilation of JavaScript files on change, improving the development workflow.

## üêõ Bug Fixes
- **Run from Anywhere:** Updated `start_or_restart_server.sh` to be executable from any directory by using an absolute path.
- **Character Encoding:** Fixed an emoji display issue (`√¢≈ì‚Ä¶`) by adding `<meta charset="UTF-8">` to `popup.html`.
- **GIF Sizing:** Adjusted the loading GIF's CSS to have a fixed width of 50px with an automatic height to maintain its aspect ratio.

##  chore
- **Gitignore:** Added a `.gitignore` file to exclude logs, cache, and other unnecessary files from the repository.
- **Project Setup:** Initialized an npm project with `package.json`.
- **Icons:** Cleaned up and standardized extension icons.
