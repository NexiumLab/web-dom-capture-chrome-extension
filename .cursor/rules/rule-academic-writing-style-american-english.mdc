# Rule: Professional Academic Writing Style (American English)

## 1. Objective
To provide a comprehensive guide for writing professional research papers in American English, tailored for a PhD and professorial audience. This rule emphasizes clarity, precision, formality, and logical, evidence-based argumentation.

## 2. Core Principles

- **Thesis-Driven:** The entire paper must be centered around a clear, specific, and debatable thesis statement presented early in the introduction.
- **Linear & Logical Flow:** The argument must progress in a straightforward, logical manner. Each section and paragraph should connect clearly to the next, building upon the last.
- **Evidence-Based:** All claims and arguments must be rigorously supported by credible, relevant, and properly cited evidence appropriate to the academic discipline.
- **Objectivity & Formality:** The tone must be impersonal, objective, and formal. Avoid colloquialisms, slang, contractions, and emotive language.

## 3. Structure of an Academic Paper (IMRaD)

While flexible, a common and effective structure for scientific papers is IMRaD:

- **Introduction:**
    - Provide background and context for the research topic.
    - Clearly state the research problem or question.
    - Present the thesis statement or main argument.
    - Briefly outline the structure of the paper.
- **Methods:**
    - Describe the methodology used to conduct the research in sufficient detail for replication.
    - Explain the choice of methods and any limitations.
- **Results:**
    - Present the findings of the research objectively, without interpretation.
    - Use figures, tables, and graphs to present data clearly.
- **and Discussion:**
    - Interpret the results and explain their significance.
    - Relate the findings back to the research question and thesis statement.
    - Acknowledge limitations of the study.
    - Discuss implications for future research.
- **Conclusion:**
    - Summarize the main findings and arguments.
    - Reiterate the thesis in a new light.
    - Offer final thoughts on the broader significance of the work. Do not introduce new evidence here.

## 4. Language and Tone

### 4.1. Precision and Clarity
- **Specific Language:** Use precise nouns and strong, specific verbs. Avoid vague words like `thing`, `stuff`, or `aspect`.
    - *Instead of:* "This had a major impact..."
    - *Use:* "This policy significantly reduced unemployment rates..."
- **Conciseness:** Eliminate wordiness, redundancy, and unnecessary phrases.
    - *Instead of:* "It is a matter of fact that the results were conclusive."
    - *Use:* "The results were conclusive."
- **Clarity of Pronouns:** Ensure every pronoun (`it`, `they`, `this`, `that`) refers unambiguously to a specific noun. If there is any doubt, repeat the noun.

### 4.2. Formality and Objectivity
- **Avoid Contractions:** Use "do not" instead of "don't," "cannot" instead of "can't."
- **Impersonal Voice:** Use the third person ("The study revealed that...") or a passive voice construction where appropriate to maintain objectivity. While the active voice ("We found that...") is increasingly accepted, the third person remains a safer, more formal standard.
- **Avoid Rhetorical Questions:** State points directly rather than asking questions.
- **Hedging Language:** Use cautious language to qualify claims. Words like `suggests`, `indicates`, `may`, `could`, `appears to be` are crucial for academic honesty. Avoid absolute claims using `proves`, `always`, or `never`.

## 5. Grammar and Punctuation (American English Style)

- **Punctuation with Quotation Marks:** Commas and periods are placed *inside* the closing quotation mark.
    - *Example:* The results were described as "significant," which the authors later clarified.
- **Serial Comma (Oxford Comma):** Use a comma before the final "and" or "or" in a list of three or more items.
    - *Example:* The study considered economic, social, and political factors.
- **Verb Tense:**
    - **Literature Review:** Use present tense ("Smith (2020) argues that...").
    - **Describing Methods/Results:** Use past tense ("We collected data...", "The temperature increased...").
    - **Discussing Implications/Conclusions:** Use present tense ("The results suggest that...").

## 6. Citation and Referencing

- **Consistency is Key:** Choose one citation style (e.g., APA, MLA, Chicago, IEEE) and apply it consistently throughout the paper.
- **Avoid Plagiarism:** Every idea, piece of data, or direct quote that is not your own must be cited.
- **Paraphrasing vs. Quoting:** Prefer paraphrasing to demonstrate your understanding. Use direct quotes sparingly, only when the author's exact wording is essential.
