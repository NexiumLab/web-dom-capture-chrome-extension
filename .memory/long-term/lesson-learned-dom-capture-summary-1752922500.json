    "what": "Developed a tool to capture a webpage's DOM and save it locally.",
    "why": "To create a simple, robust, and automated way of saving web page structures for analysis, after an initial attempt using the File System Access API proved too complex and unreliable.",
    "how": "The architecture was pivoted to a client-server model. The Chrome Extension acts as a client, capturing the DOM and sending it via a POST request to a local Python Flask server. The server then handles saving the content to a local file, managing file rotation, and prepending instructions.",
    "learnings": "For tasks involving local file system interaction from a browser extension, a local server model can be significantly simpler and more reliable (KISS principle) than using browser-native APIs like File System Access, which have heavy security restrictions and complex persistence logic."
